# GeoStructure: Semi-Automatic Fracture Orientation Extraction from Point Clouds, using Machine Learning and Region Growing

This is the official implementation of GeoStructure, an algorithmic software pipleine designed to extract Fracture Orientation measurements from a [software generated] point cloud. Data is cleaned of outliers using a Mahalanobis distance method, segmented using a kNN Region Growing technique and Fracture Orientations determined using Direction Cosines method. For technical details, please refer to:
